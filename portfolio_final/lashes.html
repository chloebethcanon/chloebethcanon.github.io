        <h1>Lash Policies</h1>

        <div class="policy-container">
            <ul>
                <li>It takes between 2-3 hours to complete a full set of lash extensions. I'm committed to providing the best possible service and results and don't rush the process. Please be sure you can lay down for that amount of time before booking.</li>
                <li>I will not work over another lash artist's work. If you have lash extensions by a previous artist at the time of your appointment, please book a FULL SET. Old lashes will be removed for a small fee.</li>
                <li>Please do not wear makeup to your lash appointment. Eye makeup will need to be removed for a small fee.</li>                    
                <li>Although I love to hear your stories, please do not talk excessively during your lash appointment. Your eyes flutter when you talk, which prolongs the process and may cause glue fumes to irritate your eyes. I suggest brining headphone or even taking a nap.</li>
                <li>Avoid caffeine before your lash appointment to help you lay still for the necessary amount of time.</li>
            </ul>
